__Usage__


__Design__


USA companies provide all parts in these schematics.

__Safety__
Contrary to typical RAMBo motherboard expectations, Vsys directly from PSU is used for Hotend power, and may be unfused.

LulzBot Mini, Taz5, and similar, connectors, must be tested to adhere to specified Hotend Heater polarity. Reverse connection may present unfused (all RAMBo motherboard fuses bypassed) short-circuit load exceeding 20A, severely overloading MOSFET, wiring, and connectors.
