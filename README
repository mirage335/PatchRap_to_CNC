Compact adapters for CNC machines, converting PatchRap standards to other connectors, including solderable wire-to-board.

__Usage__

Beware that in practice, the generic PatchRap patches are at least as versatile, being breadboard friendly. Specialized adapters may be only rarely justified.

___ PatchRap_to_CNC__WiringDiagram_GenericRap ___

Typically intended to serve as a wiring diagram. Standard solid-core copper Cat5E or similar 'Ethernet' wire can typically plug into a breadboard directly.

Alternatively, may be used as a flexible PCB layout, with breakaway header sockets installed where appropriate.

Beware, some extruders may draw enough current from the 'heater' wires to require multiple connections to the breadboard.


__Design__

WARNING: Correct color coding requires launching PCB with correct color coding parameters, such as with the '_pcb_color_T568A' script provided by "gEDA_designer" . From there, the diagram may be used interactively with 'f' and 'Shift + f' keybindings, or exported to PNG from the PCB program.

WARNING: PCB 'exclude' layers may be used to document connections within components. These possible distractions should be omitted from fabricated PCBs, printed wiring diagrams, mechanical assembly guides, and similar.

USA companies provide all parts in these schematics.

__Safety__
Contrary to typical RAMBo motherboard expectations, Vsys directly from PSU is used for Hotend power, and may be unfused.

LulzBot Mini, Taz5, and similar, connectors, must be tested to adhere to specified Hotend Heater polarity. Reverse connection may present unfused (all RAMBo motherboard fuses bypassed) short-circuit load exceeding 20A, severely overloading MOSFET, wiring, and connectors.

Consider adding fiberglass or silica high-temperature sleeving to wiring near hotend.
